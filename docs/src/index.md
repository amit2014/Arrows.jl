# Arrows.jl

Arrows.jl is a differentiable programming environment implemented in Julia.  The goal is to combine the benefits of deep neural networks - namely, that they are differentiable, -  with the benefits of modern programming languages - recursion, modularity, higher-orderness, types.
To do this, we build upon the formalism of Arrows.

## Installation

Arrows is built in Julia but not yet in the official Julia Package repository.  You can still easily install it from a Julia repl with:

```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/zenna/Arrows.jl.git")
```


```@contents
```

```@index
```

Arrows.jl's documentation
=========================

Arrows is a probabilistic programming environment implemented in Julia.
In it, you can specify probabilistic models as normal programs, and perform inference.

Arrows is built on top of Julia but not yet in the official Julia Package repository.  You can still easily install it from a Julia repl with:

.. code-block:: julia

  Pkg.clone("https://github.com/zenna/Arrows.jl.git")

Arrows is then loaded with

.. code-block:: julia

  using Arrows
